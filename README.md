🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction
This project predicts the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning models based on the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

📌 Objective
To build a classification model that can predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features such as age, sex, class, fare, and more.

📂 Dataset
The dataset includes the following files:

train.csv – Training data

test.csv – Test data (without target labels)

gender_submission.csv – Example submission

Features used:

Pclass (Ticket class)

Sex

Age

SibSp (Siblings/Spouses aboard)

Parch (Parents/Children aboard)

Fare

Embarked (Port of Embarkation)

Target variable:

Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

🧠 Machine Learning Pipeline
Data Preprocessing

Handle missing values

Convert categorical variables to numerical (e.g., Sex, Embarked)

Feature scaling (if needed)

Feature engineering (e.g., creating FamilySize)

Modeling

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

XGBoost (optional)

Evaluation

Accuracy

Confusion Matrix

Cross-validation
